basically we are gonna 
"Fetch, Decode, Execute"
instructions from the ROM.

> read opcodes from the ROM, 2bytes
> Main memory(RAM) is 4096 bytes long - implemented using an array
> CPU registers are named as VX, X ranges from 0 to F, all being 8 bits
> There's a 2byte I register and PC
> total number of pixels on the emulator is 64 x 32 = 2048.
> Its all either 1/0 and 1byte long char for each location on screen
> There are two timers named delay and sound timer, 60Hz each
> The stack[16] is a 16 level system which is 16 bits long.
> It saves the pc's current address before the pc jumps to another subroutine
> There's a stack pointer, SP used in the stack
> Keypad is implemented using an array of len 16
